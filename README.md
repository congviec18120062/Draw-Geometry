# Draw-Geometry (v1.7.0)

This is [drawing-app](https://congviec18120062.github.io/Draw-Geometry/) with simple UI. Moreover, my inspiration is GSP and Geogebra which I use during highschool.

![Feuerbach theorem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/congviec18120062/Draw-Geometry/master/img/Feuerbach%20theorem.jpg)
This is Feuerbach theorem (Nine point circle tanglent incircle)

## HOW TO

Just press [this link](https://congviec18120062.github.io/Draw-Geometry/) and enjoy.

## CUSTOMIZE

We have 5 main type: Mouse, Point, Line, Circle and Conic with show in top-left

### Mouse

![Mouse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/congviec18120062/Draw-Geometry/master/img/mouse.jpg)

In top-right we have 4 option:

- Normal: Only choose, draw point, line and circle.
- Eraser: This can hide only a single object.
- Show: This can show all objct which was eraser or hide.
- Hide: This is opposite of show.

### Point

![Point](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/congviec18120062/Draw-Geometry/master/img/point.jpg)

In top-right we have 4 option:

- Normal: Only draw a point.
- Midpoint: Draw midpoint between two points.
> Choose two point or choose one segment
- Intersect: Intersection of two lines.
> Choose two lines, two circle or one circle and one line (one line and one circle is similar)

### Line

![Line](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/congviec18120062/Draw-Geometry/master/img/line.jpg)

In top-right we have 4 option:

- Normal: Only draw a line.
> Choose two points
- Perpen: This is perpendicular line from one point to one line.
> Choose one point and one line (one line and one circle is similar)
- Parallel: This is parallel line of one point and one line.
- Segment: This is segment between two points.
- Angle: This is angle bisector.

### Circle

![Circle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/congviec18120062/Draw-Geometry/master/img/circle.jpg)

In top-right we have 4 option:

- Normal: Only draw a circle.
- Circum: This is circumcircle go throught three points.
- Incircle: This is circle of triangle.

### Conic

In top-right we have 5 option

- Normal: Only draw a conic
