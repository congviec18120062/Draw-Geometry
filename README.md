This is [drawing-app](https://congviec18120062.github.io/Draw-Geometry/) with simple UI|UX. Moreover, my inspiration is GSP and Geogebra which I use during highschool.

![Euler cirlce](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/congviec18120062/Draw-Geometry/master/img/Feuerbach theorem.jpg)
This is Feuerbach theorem (Nine point circle tanglent incircle)

## HOW TO
Just press [this link](https://congviec18120062.github.io/Draw-Geometry/) and enjoy. 

## CUSTOMIZE
We have 5 main type: Mouse, Point, Line, Circle and Conic with show in top-left

### Mouse
![Mouse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/congviec18120062/Draw-Geometry/master/img/mouse.jpg)

In top-right we have 4 option: 

* Normal: Only choose, draw point, line and circle.
* Eraser: This can hide only a single object.
* Show: This can show all objct which was eraser or hide.
* Hide: This is opposite of show.

![Point](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/congviec18120062/Draw-Geometry/master/img/point.jpg)

In top-right we have 4 option: 

* Normal: Only draw a point.
* Midpoint: Draw midpoint between two points.
* Intersect: Intersection of two lines.

![Line](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/congviec18120062/Draw-Geometry/master/img/line.jpg)

In top-right we have 4 option: 

* Normal: Only draw a line.
* Perpen: This is perpendicular line from one point to one line.
* Parallel: This is parallel line of one point and one line.
* Segment: This is segment between two points.

![Circle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/congviec18120062/Draw-Geometry/master/img/circle.jpg)

In top-right we have 4 option: 

* Normal: Only draw a circle.
* Circum: This is circumcircle go throught three points.
* Incircle: This is circle of triangle.
